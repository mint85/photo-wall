# Photo Wall

Photo Wall is a Python/Django application that lets users upload their favorite photos to create a beautiful digital 'wall' of photos. Each photo has its own details page that displays unique information about the photo including name and description.

Users can create an account with Photo Wall to perform full CRUD operations, including the ability to add new photos, edit existing photos, and delete their photos from the database.

Each user's Photo Wall is private and can only be viewed when they are logged in.
